        <h1>The Best Movies according to Bittu</h1>
        <h2>My top three movies all time.</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>The Beutiful Mind</h3>
        <p>
            This is the most inspiring movie I ever watched. The story evolves
            around the Nobel laureate scientist and mathematician John Nash.
            John was the genius but had a rare disease of Schizophrenia. How he
            overcome his disabilities and achieve the prestigious position in
            life is the main plot of the movie.
        </p>
        <h3>Saving Private Ryan</h3>
        <p>
            The most energitic movie is the masterpiece of Stephen Spillburg
            which is set on the background of WWII D-day invasion at the Omaha
            Beach of Nazi occupied France. This movie shows the barbaric events
            of world war 2 and try to spread humanity and love over the hatred.
        </p>
        <h3>Interstellar</h3>
        <p>
            This is an epic science fiction movie which shows the jouney through
            the warm hole and gient black hole based on estabilished scientific
            theories.
